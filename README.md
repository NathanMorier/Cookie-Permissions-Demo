<h1>Cookie Permissions Demo</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This is a bottom-of-page permissions banner for cookie permissions. It includes demo text, a "privacy policy" link, a link to learn more about cookies, and of course an agreement button to accept cookies.</p>

<h3>A Few things to note</h3>
<ul>
<li>The approximate amount of code written by me amongst all of these files is about 120 lines, with additional supporting code that would allow it to work if placed in a demo setting. All such code is labelled accordingly.</li>
<li>This repo includes a styles.css and a styles.scss file, whichever file type is most appropriate can be chosen for any given project.</li>
<li>The index.php contains code that pertains to the WordPress WPML plugin, if the plugin isn't being used in the project, that code can be removed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>I've labelled everything noteworthy in the code comments, they should clarify how to use the code, as well as indicate if there's portions that can be removed if they're not necissary for the project.</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>A live demo of this Cookie Permissions Demo can be found here on replit: <a href="https://replit.com/@nathanrmorier/Cookie-Permissions#index.php" target="_blank">Demo</a></p>
<p>A demo of this can also be found on the live site of <a href="https://www.hellobc.com" target="_blank">hellobc.com</a>, <em>however it should be noted</em> that other contributors to the site have made changes to the component since I had created it, and it will no longer be an exact match.</p>
